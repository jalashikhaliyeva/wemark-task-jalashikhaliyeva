## Description

This project is a responsive e-commerce landing page built with Next.js and TypeScript. It consumes dynamic data from a REST API for the Hero section, Services, Products, and Categories. The interface features client-side filtering, infinite scroll loading in batches of 8 items for optimal performance and user experience, and persistent context for cart and favorites counts.

Several additional sections were implemented based on Figma designs, utilizing mock data where appropriate.
